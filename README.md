# BreastCancer

This project focuses on predicting breast cancer diagnoses using advanced machine learning techniques. It leverages a dataset (Breast_Cancer.csv) containing patient diagnostic information and evaluates the performance of eight machine learning models for research purposes.

--- Key Highlights ----
Machine Learning Models Used:
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest (RF) classifier
LightGBM
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)
Voting Classifier (Ensemble of Models)
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

-- Dataset : Contains diagnostic features to classify malignant and benign tumors.

-- Research Focus:
Comparing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Implementing ensemble methods (Voting Classifier) to improve prediction robustness.
Exploring the strengths of individual models for breast cancer prediction.

-- Features:
Preprocessing of the dataset for optimal model performance.
Training and evaluation of each model with hyperparameter tuning.
Ensemble learning to combine predictions for improved accuracy.
Visualizations of model performance and feature importance.
